# Analyzing the Distribution of Vacant Buildings in Baltimore City
How can we better understand the relationship between vacant buildings and geographic distribution of race and income? 

The sections below will cover the following: 
* Challenge/Problem: History of Baltimore infrastructure and problems residents have experienced  
* Solution: Data analysis of number of vacant houses by neighborhood based on race and median income 
* Suggestion: Application of data findings to Baltimore City legislation 

## Why is this a Challenge/Problem? 
The high volume of vacant buildings present a [huge safety and public health problem in Baltimore City](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/07/08/why-cant-baltimore-solve-vacant-housing-problem/). There have been documented cases of vacant buildings collapsing on pedestrians and are detrimental to overall quality of life. Additionally, with more people leaving Baltimore City, there large swaths of 10-20 row houses being hollowed out and 1 in 3 houses vacant in West Baltimore.

(talk about the blackbutterfly and connect to race + vacant houses)  
The map above shows the ["Black Butterfly"](https://apps.urban.org/features/baltimore-investment-flows/), a description of the butterfly wing shape of segregated black communities dispered across Baltimore City's eastern and western halves. The ["White L"](https://ncrc.org/the-black-butterfly/) is comprised of high-income neighborhoods located around Inner Harbor to the North. When the vacant buildings are mapped geographically by neighborhoods, they similarly form the shape of the black butterfly as well. 


## Your Solution

What did you find? You don’t need to write up an explanation for each document you upload, but it should be clear what kind of analysis you conducted, why you chose this type of analysis, and your findings from each analysis uploaded. You can also upload data analysis that didn’t directly contribute to your business answer and suggestions to provide a robust background on your research. It should be clear to anyone in the class who isn’t in your group how you came to your data conclusions.

This graph was created using a Pivot Table to understand how median household income is distributed across Baltimore City by neighborhoods. The top 5 neighborhoods located in north, south, and central Baltimore and the bottom 5 neighborhoods are located in west and southeast Baltimore. This suggests that there are wealth inequities and the wealth distribution is not equal across the neighborhoods and districts.

Looking at the total number of vacant buildings in Baltimore City by neighborhood, we can see that there is a stark discrepancy between neighborhoods in the eastern/western halves vs. north/south. The top 5 neighborhoods with the highest total number of vacant buildings are located in East, northern, southwestern, and southeastern Baltimore. The bottom 5 neighborhoods 

It is important to note that some neighborhoods are grouped together due to the combination of several data sets.

Plotting the vacant buildings and median household income in Baltimore City neighborhoods together, we can see that the trendline suggests a slight inverse relationship. As the median household income increases, the total number of vacant buildings are less likely to be a prominent issue in the high-income neighborhoods.

Within the black residing neighborhoods, the total vacant buildings

It is important to note that the black butterfly suggests racial disparities are clustered within the western and eastern halves of Baltimore. In the graph above, the highest number of vacant buildings are within the western and eastern police districts, suggesting that race could be a significant factor. 

![insert7](https://github.com/EuniceNamkoong/Vacant-Buildings-Baltimore-City-Income-Race/blob/main/Cluster%20Nodes%20Grouping%20Table.png)

Combining all the data above, a cluster analysis was conducted to group like neighborhoods by charactersistics. 
* Cluster 1: 
  * higher than average Black residents
  * lower than average White residents
  * higher than average percent of households below the poverty line
  * lower than the average household median income
  * much higher than average vacant buildings 
* Cluster 2: 
  * lower than average Black residents
  * higher than average White residents
  * lower than average number of households below the poverty line
  * lower than the average household median income
  * lower vacant buildings cluster
* Cluster 3: 
  * higher than average Black residents
  * lower than average White residents
  * lower than average number of households below the poverty line
  * lower than the average household median income
  * slightly higher than average vacant buildings cluster
* Cluster 4: 
  * much lower than average Black residents
  * much higher than average White residents
  * much lower than average number of households below the poverty line
  * much higher than the average household median income
  * lower than average vacant buildings cluster
 

## Future Suggestions
Projections to completely get rid of the house vacancy problem in Baltimore is over a billion dollars (insert link). However, working to efficiently enact this current legislation will reduce time, cost, and effort. According to DHCD, it would cost the agency $39k in the first year for supplies, printing costs, and staff and $14k each year after. Therefore, efficient policy enactment will significantly reduce costs. 

If given more time, we would further analyze more data, information regarding population loss, crime rates by neighborhood, state funding and money allocation based on public health issues. Having access to this information can help 1) see overview of which neighborhoods should be prioritized in terms of development and funding 2) which neighborhoods are getting funding already (needs more), getting funding already (doesn’t need anymore), is not getting funding (needs fundings). 

Proposed Policy Solution: 
To put our findings into action, we wanted to focus on strengthening existing Baltimore City legisation. In August 2019, [Baltimore Councilman Burnett](https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2020/09/21/council-bill-signage-qr-code-vacant-properties.html) proposed a new way for Baltimore to hold negligent owners accountable. However, just recently, as of this past March, the [Law Department amended the bill](
https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/burnetts-bill-would-force-vacant-property-owners-to-post-a-sign-or-a-pay-a-fine/) to have DHCD as the party responsible for posting the signage instead of the owners themselves. Instead of a paper sign, they must publish a [scannable QR code](https://www.qrcodepress.com/new-legislation-may-bring-vacancy-qr-codes-to-baltimore/8538335/) and phone line rather than a printed address, name, and other contact information which can become outdated after being published.The goal of the vacancy QR codes is to help make slumlord accountable for these empty buildings across the city and make these spaces more accessible to their neighbors. 

How our data can be important:
1) agency can focus on covering certain police districts 
2) focus on neighborhoods within clusters 1 and 3 when making inspection rounds to make the most efficient impact revitalizing the city.
